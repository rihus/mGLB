# mGLB
Repository for median or mean-anchored generalized linear binning analysis pipeline to analyze 129Xe ventilation MRI imaging, written in Python.

There are several steps required to run the analysis successfully:
1. Install all required libraries
2. Give a path to main data directory, and names of the folders containing the nifti files
3. Nifti files should be named as in the script (or change the file names--or strings-- accordingly).
4. Analyses should automatically generate histograms and Z-score for median- or mean-anchored gneralized linear binning.
